harness-archived-meds-patch.py -- beta-v62. Archived medications can be seen and brought back.

Aaron, 2026-09-11, picking Enhancer item A: "Do A, B and C."

THE GAP. The app has carried `archivedMeds` for many releases -- removing a medication keeps its
name so old doses still render properly -- but there was NO SCREEN anywhere that listed them and no
way to bring one back. A medication paused between cycles had to be re-created by hand, and
re-created with a NEW id, which means every dose that referenced the old one reads as a removed
medication. The data was never lost; it was simply unreachable.

THE WRITE MODEL, stated before a line was written.

  * APPENDS: nothing. This release never writes, edits or deletes an ENTRY. Not one code path here
    touches the entries collection.
  * CHANGES: the medication CONFIG only -- `meds` and `archivedMeds` -- through the existing
    persistMedicationConfig(), the same path every medication edit has always used.
  * THE ARCHIVE NOW KEEPS THE WHOLE MEDICATION (`config`) beside the {name, sub} it already kept.
    Nothing that used to be kept is dropped. There is precedent: ChemoWell widened this same record
    once before, to keep `pausePeriods`, for the same reason -- a half-remembered medication comes
    back wrong.
  * RESTORE PUTS IT BACK UNDER ITS ORIGINAL ID. That is the entire point: the dose history
    references that id, so the old doses read properly again. A new id would leave them orphaned,
    which is what re-creating by hand does today.
  * REMINDERS COME BACK EXACTLY AS THEY WERE, AND THE GAP IS WHAT IS SUPPRESSED. Restore stamps
    `alertsFrom` with today and missedDosesFor() skips days before it for that medication.
    THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS RELEASE GOT THIS WRONG and the audit refused it -- twice over, in
    opposite directions. It restored the medication with reminders switched OFF, which in ChemoWell
    was erased at the next app open (its normaliser RECOMPUTES `alerts` from the schedule type and
    never reads what was saved), and in care-tracker stayed off FOREVER under a toast promising
    "turn them back on in Edit" when the editor has no such control at all. Either way it removed
    missed-dose cover invisibly, under a button labelled "Bring back".
    The design was wrong, not just the code: "reminders off" trades a VISIBLE, recoverable problem
    -- a wall of missed doses for days she was not taking it -- for an INVISIBLE, unrecoverable one.
    A clinician takes the first every time.
    SAID OUT LOUD: a phone still on the OLD build ignores `alertsFrom` and shows the gap as missed
    until it updates. That is visible and self-correcting; silent loss of alerting is neither.
  * TIE-BREAK: if an ACTIVE medication already holds that id, restore is REFUSED and says why.
    Restoring over it, or under a new id, would silently sever the dose history.
  * TWICE: the second restore is a no-op. The id is gone from the archive after the first.
  * HALF-FAILURE: identical to every other medication edit -- localStorage first, then medsync
    publishes. Nothing new to get wrong.
  * AN OLDER BUILD reading a richer archive strips `config` back to {name, sub} on its next write.
    No live data is at risk: restore falls back to the medication this app SHIPS with, then to the
    name alone, and the toast says which of the three it used rather than pretending.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
  * It does not touch the Home quick-log cards or the entries.
  * It adds exactly ONE line to the missed-dose engine -- a guard keyed on `alertsFrom`, a field no
    medication that was never archived carries, so for every one of them it does nothing at all.
  * The Archived section renders ONLY when something is archived. An empty notice about a list with
    nothing in it is the bug the sibling app's audit found in v74.

Usage:  python3 harness-archived-meds-patch.py [--base outputs/rollback-v74/index.html] [--out index.html]
The version stamp lives INSIDE this patch: it refuses a base that is not beta-v61 and emits beta-v62.

B and C from the sibling app are carried here too, so the three apps do not drift.
