harness-archived-meds-patch.py -- beta-v62. Archived medications can be seen and brought back.

Aaron, 2026-09-11, picking Enhancer item A: "Do A, B and C."

THE GAP. The app has carried `archivedMeds` for many releases -- removing a medication keeps its
name so old doses still render properly -- but there was NO SCREEN anywhere that listed them and no
way to bring one back. A medication paused between cycles had to be re-created by hand, and
re-created with a NEW id, which means every dose that referenced the old one reads as a removed
medication. The data was never lost; it was simply unreachable.

THE WRITE MODEL, stated before a line was written.

  * APPENDS: nothing. This release never writes, edits or deletes an ENTRY. Not one code path here
    touches the entries collection.
  * CHANGES: the medication CONFIG only -- `meds` and `archivedMeds` -- through the existing
    persistMedicationConfig(), the same path every medication edit has always used.
  * THE ARCHIVE NOW KEEPS THE WHOLE MEDICATION (`config`) beside the {name, sub} it already kept.
    Nothing that used to be kept is dropped. There is precedent: ChemoWell widened this same record
    once before, to keep `pausePeriods`, for the same reason -- a half-remembered medication comes
    back wrong.
  * RESTORE PUTS IT BACK UNDER ITS ORIGINAL ID. That is the entire point: the dose history
    references that id, so the old doses read properly again. A new id would leave them orphaned,
    which is what re-creating by hand does today.
  * REMINDERS COME BACK EXACTLY AS THEY WERE, AND WHAT IS SUPPRESSED IS THE SPAN IT WAS AWAY --
    BOTH ENDS OF IT. Removal writes down the day the medication left (`removedAt`); restore turns
    that into an `awayPeriods` span from that day to this one; the missed-dose walk skips a day only
    when it falls INSIDE one of those spans.
    THE SECOND VERSION OF THIS RELEASE STAMPED `alertsFrom` AND SKIPPED EVERYTHING BEFORE IT, and
    the audit refused that too -- worse than the first. The span a medication is archived for is
    only ever part of "everything before now", so bringing one back erased every missed dose it had
    ever had: 122 misses over two months gone from the banner, the day summaries and the report
    that goes to the doctor, for a medication off the list for two seconds.
    THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS RELEASE GOT THIS WRONG and the audit refused it -- twice over, in
    opposite directions. It restored the medication with reminders switched OFF, which in ChemoWell
    was erased at the next app open (its normaliser RECOMPUTES `alerts` from the schedule type and
    never reads what was saved), and in care-tracker stayed off FOREVER under a toast promising
    "turn them back on in Edit" when the editor has no such control at all. Either way it removed
    missed-dose cover invisibly, under a button labelled "Bring back".
    The design was wrong, not just the code: "reminders off" trades a VISIBLE, recoverable problem
    -- a wall of missed doses for days she was not taking it -- for an INVISIBLE, unrecoverable one.
    A clinician takes the first every time.
    SAID OUT LOUD, and the audit is right that it matters more than it looks:
      - AN ARCHIVE ENTRY WRITTEN BY ANY EARLIER BUILD HAS NO `removedAt`. It restores with a
        single-day span and suppresses NOTHING. Since no build before this one could list removed
        medications, the first one anybody brings back is necessarily such an entry. The app knows
        which case it is in and SAYS so -- per row and in the toast -- rather than promising
        something it cannot do.
      - A phone still on the OLD build ignores `awayPeriods` and shows the days as missed until it
        updates. Visible and self-correcting; silent loss of alerting would be neither.
      - THE SPAN COMES FROM THE DEVICE CLOCK, so a phone with the wrong date records a wrong span.
      - THE DAY OF THE RESTORE IS ITSELF INSIDE THE SPAN (the range is inclusive at both ends), so
        a dose window already missed earlier that same day is not counted. One day, deliberate: the
        alternative flags a medication for hours when it was not on the list.
      - A SPAN CANNOT BE CLEARED. Restore appends; nothing removes. Bringing a medication back a
        second time adds a second span rather than replacing the first, and no screen shows either.
        Deliberate -- a control that edits suppression is a control that can hide real missed doses
        -- AND IT CANNOT BE UNDONE: removing the medication archives it, spans and all, and
        bringing it back re-adds them. There is no purge control anywhere in this app. An earlier
        draft said deleting the medication cleared it; it does not.
  * TIE-BREAK: if an ACTIVE medication already holds that id, restore is REFUSED and says why.
    Restoring over it, or under a new id, would silently sever the dose history.
  * TWICE: the second restore is a no-op. The id is gone from the archive after the first.
  * HALF-FAILURE: identical to every other medication edit -- localStorage first, then medsync
    publishes. Nothing new to get wrong.
  * AN OLDER BUILD reading a richer archive strips `config` back to {name, sub} on its next write.
    No live data is at risk: restore falls back to the medication this app SHIPS with, then to the
    name alone, and the toast says which of the three it used rather than pretending.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
  * It does not touch the Home quick-log cards or the entries.
  * It adds exactly ONE line to the missed-dose engine -- a guard reading `awayPeriods`, a field no
    medication that was never archived carries, so for every one of them it does nothing at all.
  * The Archived section renders ONLY when something is archived. An empty notice about a list with
    nothing in it is the bug the sibling app's audit found in v74.

      // AND IT CANNOT END IN THE FUTURE. This app only ever writes a span ending on the day of the
      // restore, so an end beyond now did not come from it -- and that is the shape that does real
      // damage: {start: 1, end: <far future>} suppresses every missed dose the record holds.
      // Rejecting malformed spans was not enough; the first version of this filter passed that one.
      // SAID OUT LOUD, because it is a real limit rather than an oversight: a span ending in the
      // PAST cannot be checked this way -- it is indistinguishable from a medication that was
      // genuinely off the list for a long time. The narrow way one could arise here is a phone whose
      // DATE WAS WRONG AT THE MOMENT OF REMOVAL and was corrected afterwards.
      // AND IT CANNOT BE UNDONE. Removing the medication ARCHIVES it, spans and all, and bringing it
      // back re-adds them; there is no purge control anywhere in this app, by design, because a
      // control that edits suppression is a control that can hide real missed doses. An earlier
      // version of this comment said deleting the medication undid it. It does not, and the audit
      // was right to refuse that twice.
      // WHAT ACTUALLY MAKES THIS SAFE, stated from a measurement rather than from what would be
      // reassuring: NO ENTRY IS WRITTEN, EDITED OR DELETED by any of this, every logged dose stays
      // exactly where it is, and the suppression is DERIVED AT RENDER TIME -- drop the span and every
      // count returns exactly.
      // WHAT A SPAN DOES CHANGE is every surface fed by missedDosesFor(): the banner, the card's
      // MISSED label, Today's journal, the History rows and day summaries, and the derived
      // missed-dose rows in the clinician export. An earlier version of THIS comment said a span
      // changes "only what the banner counts" and that "the export reads the entries themselves".
      // Measured on a 14-day span: the export drops 305 rows to 277 and 14 History days change their
      // MISSED count. It was false, it contradicted this file's own guard comment, and it was the
      // FIFTH safety claim in this release the audit refused for describing a property the code does
      // not have. Do not write a reassurance here that has not been measured.
