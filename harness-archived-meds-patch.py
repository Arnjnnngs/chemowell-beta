harness-archived-meds-patch.py -- beta-v62. Archived medications can be seen and brought back.

Aaron, 2026-09-11, picking Enhancer item A: "Do A, B and C."

THE GAP. The app has carried `archivedMeds` for many releases -- removing a medication keeps its
name so old doses still render properly -- but there was NO SCREEN anywhere that listed them and no
way to bring one back. A medication paused between cycles had to be re-created by hand, and
re-created with a NEW id, which means every dose that referenced the old one reads as a removed
medication. The data was never lost; it was simply unreachable.

THE WRITE MODEL, stated before a line was written.

  * APPENDS: nothing. This release never writes, edits or deletes an ENTRY. Not one code path here
    touches the entries collection.
  * CHANGES: the medication CONFIG only -- `meds` and `archivedMeds` -- through the existing
    persistMedicationConfig(), the same path every medication edit has always used.
  * THE ARCHIVE NOW KEEPS THE WHOLE MEDICATION (`config`) beside the {name, sub} it already kept.
    Nothing that used to be kept is dropped. There is precedent: ChemoWell widened this same record
    once before, to keep `pausePeriods`, for the same reason -- a half-remembered medication comes
    back wrong.
  * RESTORE PUTS IT BACK UNDER ITS ORIGINAL ID. That is the entire point: the dose history
    references that id, so the old doses read properly again. A new id would leave them orphaned,
    which is what re-creating by hand does today.
  * RESTORE ALWAYS COMES BACK WITH REMINDERS OFF, whatever the archive says, and the app says so on
    screen. THIS IS THE TRAP THIS RELEASE EXISTS TO AVOID. missedDosesFor() walks every day since
    MISSED_TRACK_SINCE and asks `state.meds.filter(m => m.alerts && m.windows)`. Restore a tracked
    medication with alerts on and every dose window during the weeks it was archived is instantly
    flagged as missed -- the exact flood that ending a hospital stay produced once already, and the
    reason per-window suppression was built. Reminders off means the gap is silent, and the
    caregiver turns them back on in Edit when she is ready.
  * TIE-BREAK: if an ACTIVE medication already holds that id, restore is REFUSED and says why.
    Restoring over it, or under a new id, would silently sever the dose history.
  * TWICE: the second restore is a no-op. The id is gone from the archive after the first.
  * HALF-FAILURE: identical to every other medication edit -- localStorage first, then medsync
    publishes. Nothing new to get wrong.
  * AN OLDER BUILD reading a richer archive strips `config` back to {name, sub} on its next write.
    No live data is at risk: restore falls back to the medication this app SHIPS with, then to the
    name alone, and the toast says which of the three it used rather than pretending.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
  * It does not restore reminders. See above -- that is the whole safety argument.
  * It does not touch the Home quick-log cards, the entries, or the missed-dose engine. Not one
    line of missedDosesFor() changes.
  * The Archived section renders ONLY when something is archived. An empty notice about a list with
    nothing in it is the bug the sibling app's audit found in v74.

Usage:  python3 harness-archived-meds-patch.py [--base outputs/rollback-v74/index.html] [--out index.html]
The version stamp lives INSIDE this patch: it refuses a base that is not beta-v61 and emits beta-v62.

B and C from the sibling app are carried here too, so the three apps do not drift.
