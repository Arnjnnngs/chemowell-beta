// med-purpose-test.mjs -- beta-v61 (ported from care-tracker v74 and ChemoWell app-v72). Every medication says what it is for, and an edit cannot wipe it.
//
// WHAT IT PROVES
//   1. Every medication the app ships carries a line on the Meds screen, and none of them is blank.
//   2. NO LINE CONTAINS A NUMBER. This is the guard that matters: the app is now stating medical
//      information, and the one thing it must never drift into is a dose or a schedule. A digit in
//      any of these sentences is a failure, whoever added it and however well meant.
//   3. Editing a medication and saving does NOT wipe the line -- the v43.3 failure class, where
//      correcting one field in this same editor silently disabled that medication's missed-dose
//      alerts while the app said "updated".
//   4. What the caregiver types beats the built-in line.
//   5. A medication with nothing to say shows NO empty label.
//   6. THE DELIBERATE EXEMPTION, ASSERTED: the Home quick-log cards carry none of this. That screen
//      is what she taps at 2am under time pressure, and an exemption nobody wrote down is
//      indistinguishable from an oversight.
//
// FIELD LABELS ARE UPPERCASED BY CSS and innerText returns what is RENDERED, so every label match
// here is case-insensitive. A case-sensitive one went red against a build where the field was
// present and correct -- the same trap that produced a false red on "Total drained" in v69.
//
// Run:  node harness/med-purpose-test.mjs [--file <index.html>] [--shots <dir>]

  // particular medication is a question for a reader, and no list of words was ever going to answer it.
  // TWO WORDS ARE LEFT OUT ON PURPOSE, SAID OUT LOUD because an exemption nobody wrote down is
  // indistinguishable from an oversight. `oral` would reject "Treats oral thrush", a condition
  // rather than a route, and nystatin is a supportive-care drug this table may well gain.

  // taken. Both mean this list lets "An oral steroid" and "Dissolves on the tongue" through --
  // "under the tongue" is caught, "on the tongue" is not. That is the accepted cost of a list

  // A pasted no-space pharmacy name (447px), a pasted portal link (413px) and a long generic name
  // (413px) every one scrolled sideways at a 320px viewport, and the check said PASS on all three.
  // It caught the 300-character mutant only because that finally exceeded the emulator's clamp.
  // THE RULER IS NOW THE WIDTH THIS TEST ITSELF SET, passed in from Node and never read back out of
  // the page, and the cases are what a caregiver actually pastes rather than one absurd one.
  // EVERY ONE OF THESE FOUR STRINGS WAS LENGTHENED UNTIL IT COULD ACTUALLY FAIL. The first draft
  // used a 48-character pharmacy name and a 71-character link, and BOTH stayed green on a build
  // with the wrapping rule deleted -- they simply fit. Two of the four cases could not fail, in a
  // suite added because a check that could not fail sat green for weeks.
  // ONE RULE, ON THE WHOLE CARD. The previous version put it on the card's text COLUMN and left a
  // second copy on the purpose line, and claimed the two were proved non-redundant -- which the
  // audit disproved in one run, because overflow-wrap is INHERITED and the line's copy did nothing.
  // Worse, the note and the dose summary render in a DIFFERENT container from that column, so a
  // pasted pharmacy name in the note measured 668px at a 320px viewport while all four cases here
  // stayed green. The rule is on the article now, so every string the card renders is inside it --
  // which is why one of the cases below pastes into the note.
