// back-button-test.mjs -- beta-v65 (STAGING). The phone's own Back button must walk the app.
//
// ADAPTED FROM PRODUCTION'S COPY, NOT RUN AS-IS. Staging's state is close to production's and not
// identical -- no `confirmRemoveWeight`, `missedBannerOpen` or `whatsNewOpen`; it has the TEST_MODE
// date panel and `medFlash` instead. The completeness check below reads THIS app's state, so a
// copied exemption list fails it rather than passing quietly, which is how the difference was found.
//
// Aaron, 2026-09-14: "All apps close out (go to user phone home screen) when hitting the phones
// built in back button. This should at least go to the previous page... Should have been found
// already."
//
// HE IS RIGHT, AND THE REASON IT WAS MISSED IS RULE 5.5, WRITTEN INTO THIS PROJECT'S OWN MODEL.
// Every gate here asks about a STILL FRAME: does the screen fit (overflow-scan), is the copy true
// (the Voice), can she do the job (the Enhancer), does the record survive (the Zero Day Auditor),
// did the release mechanics happen (pm.py). Rule 5.5 says the one thing nobody asks is what happens
// while a finger is moving -- and the hardware Back button is the purest case of that class there
// is. `grep popstate` returned nothing in this app, in staging, or in ChemoWell. Never built.
//
// WRITTEN FOR THE CLASS, NOT THE REPORT. Section 4 reads the registry from the app AND the
// dismissible keys from the app's own `state`, so neither can be a list copied into this file and
// a new overlay cannot be added without somebody deciding what Back does to it.
//
// THE BOOT HARNESS IS THIS REPO'S, VERBATIM -- same mocked Firestore (hard rule 4: never the real
// one), same local server, same frozen clock. A second, subtly different boot is how a suite ends
// up reporting on a screen it never reached.
