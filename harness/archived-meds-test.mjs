// archived-meds-test.mjs -- v75. Removed medications can be seen and brought back.
//
// WHAT IT PROVES, and the order matters: the dangerous half first.
//   1. RESTORE BRINGS THE MEDICATION BACK WITH REMINDERS OFF. This is the whole safety argument.
//      missedDosesFor() walks every day since MISSED_TRACK_SINCE reading
//      `state.meds.filter(m => m.alerts && m.windows)`, so a tracked medication restored with
//      alerts ON flags every dose window during the weeks it was archived. The check asserts the
//      SAVED config, not the screen, and then asserts the BEHAVIOUR: the missed-dose count does
//      not move when a tracked medication comes back.
//   2. The archive keeps the whole medication, so what comes back is what went away.
//   3. Restore puts it back under its ORIGINAL id -- the reason the feature exists, since every
//      stored dose points at that id. Asserted by logging a dose, removing, restoring, and
//      requiring the dose to read with its medication again.
//   4. Restore is REFUSED when an active medication already holds that id.
//   5. Restoring twice is a no-op.
//   6. An archive written by an OLDER build (name and generic name only) restores from the
//      medication the app ships with, and the app says so rather than pretending.
//   7. THE EXEMPTION, ASSERTED: with nothing archived there is no "Removed medications" heading at
//      all. A notice about an empty list is the defect the sibling app's audit found in v74.
//
// Every assertion that matters reads the SAVED medication config out of localStorage, never the
// screen. A screen can render the right word while the record holds the wrong one -- that is the
// v43.3 failure class, and the reason the v74 suite was rebuilt four times.
